# plotly-challenge-

Built an interactive dashboard using javascript and js.d3. 

This required reading the data using D3, manipulating the html file using javascript and creating dynamic plots using Plotly.js. 

The dataset has to do with belly button microbe bidodiversity. 

This page was then launched using github pages @ https://bvmann.github.io/plotly-challenge-/
