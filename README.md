# plotly-challenge-

This was a very challenging assignment. To complete this assignment we were given an html file and data. Using the html file and data we built an interactive dashboard using javascript and js.d3. 

This required reading the data using D3, manipulating the html file using javascript and creating dynamic plots using Plotly.js. 

The dataset has to do with belly button microbe bidodiversity. 

This page was then launched using github pages.
